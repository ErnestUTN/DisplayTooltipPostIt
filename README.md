# DisplayTooltipPostIt
Mod for Project Zomboid. It displays a tooltip on post-it notes and sheet of papers when hovered with the mouse. Build 39.67.5

Just put it inside the mods folder. 

This is a WIP. It works fine, with no errors. But it hasn't got semantic controls (Make the window resize itself with the text, limit number of characters from the text  to show, etc). So, if you want to touch those aspects, you are free to continue from here.
